# Python vs. JavaScript – Syntax Differences Lab

This repo contains a translation of common JavaScript functions into Python functions, created as part of my **Unit 4** coursework at **General Assembly**.

---

## Objectives

- Understand key differences in syntax and logic between Python and JavaScript.
- Re-implement common JavaScript functions using only Python concepts introduced in class.
- Practice Python fundamentals like input/output, loops, conditionals, functions, and object structures.

## What I Learned

Each section in `differences.py` is numbered and commented for easy reference. I translated the following:

1. **Get Name** – user input and return values
2. **Reverse It** – manual string reversal using a loop
3. **Swap Em** – swapping variable values using a temp variable
4. **Multiply Array/List** – multiplying all elements in a list
5. **Fizz Buzzer** – conditional logic with modulo
6. **Nth Fibonacci** – generating values in the Fibonacci sequence
7. **Search Array/List** – linear search with loop and conditionals
8. **Palindrome** – checking symmetry in a string
9. **Has Dupes** – checking for duplicate values in a list using a dictionary

All Python features used in this file are consistent with what’s been taught so far in my introduction to the Python Language
